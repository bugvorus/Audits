### Users can split a token to more fractions than the `units` held at `tokenID`

**Description:** 

The `_splitValue` method in `SemiFungible1155` does not follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern and
it calls `_mintBatch` from the ERC1155 implementation of OpenZeppelin which will actually do a hook call to
the recipient account as a safety check. This call is unsafe as it can reenter the `_splitValue` method and since
`tokenValues[_tokenID]` hasn't been updated yet, it can once again split the tokens into more fractions and
then repeat until a huge amount of tokens get minted.

**Recommended Mitigation:**

Follow the CEI pattern

```diff

-_mintBatch(_account, toIDs, amounts, "");
-
-tokenValues[_tokenID] = valueLeft;
+tokenValues[_tokenID] = valueLeft;
+
+_mintBatch(_account, toIDs, amounts, "");

```
