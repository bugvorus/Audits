### [C-01] Users can split a token to more fractions than the `units` held at `tokenID`

**Description:** 

The `_splitValue` method in `SemiFungible1155` does not follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern and
it calls `_mintBatch` from the ERC1155 implementation of OpenZeppelin which will actually do a hook call to
the recipient account as a safety check. This call is unsafe as it can reenter the `_splitValue` method and since
`tokenValues[_tokenID]` hasn't been updated yet, it can once again split the tokens into more fractions and
then repeat until a huge amount of tokens get minted.

**Recommended Mitigation:**

Follow the CEI pattern

```diff

-_mintBatch(_account, toIDs, amounts, "");
-
-tokenValues[_tokenID] = valueLeft;
+tokenValues[_tokenID] = valueLeft;
+
+_mintBatch(_account, toIDs, amounts, "");

```

### [M-01] Unused function parameters can lead to false assumptions on user side

**Description:** 

The units parameter in `mintClaimWithFractions` is used only in the event emission. This is misleading because
 `fractions.length` number of fractions will be minted. If `units != fractions.length` this can
have unexpected consequences for a user. The same is the problem with the `account` parameter in both
`mintClaim` and `mintClaimWithFractions` - it is not used in the method and actually `msg.sender` is the
account to which tokens are minted and is set as the token creator. Again if `account != msg.sender` this is
unexpected from a user standpoint and while in the best case scenario leads to a not so great UX, in the worst
case it can lead to faulty assumptions for value received by the account address.

**Recommended Mitigation:** 

Remove the `units` parameter from `mintClaimWithFractions` and also use `account` instead of `msg.sender`
in the `_mintValue` call in `mintClaim` and `mintClaimWithFractions`.
